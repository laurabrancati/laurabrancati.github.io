<h1>Police Brutality</h1>

<p> Police brutality cases have been on the front pages of the news for an unsettling amount of time
and a focus point for many activist groups. Police brutality refers to the excessive or unwarranted
use of force on a person by a police officer <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Police-Brutality-in-the-United-States-2064580">(Moore, Police brutality in the United States)</a>.
Last year in 2020, brutality cases increased although we were in the middle of a pandemic
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/">(Fatal force: Police shootings database)</a>.
This increase, along with various tragic cases, instigated large protests throughout the country advocating for
reform and fair trials against the perpetrators. The reasons for high police brutality rates are still debated,
however. The purpose for this research is to study particular socioeconomic factors that may have a relationship with police brutality rates.
I visualized education, unemployment, and population rates of an area and overlayed it with police brutality cases. This reasearch is a first step to better understanding
the root causes of the problem.</p>

<h2>Data Gathering and Cleaning</h2>
<p>This work explores the relationship between the frequency of police killings, education, unemployment, and population per county, and how this has changed from 2015-2019.
  I am using a dataset that includes every instance of police killing civilians from 2015 to April 24th, 2021
  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/">(Fatal force: Police shootings database)</a>,
  data on highest level of education from 2015-2019 <a href= "https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/">(USDA, County-level Data Sets)</a>,
  unemployment (USDA, County-level Data Sets), and population data per county
  <a href= "https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html">(USDA, County Population Totals: 2010-2019)</a>.
  I was not able to find education data per county for each individual year as I did with the unemployment data,
  so I overlayed this data with the police brutality cases for those years together rather than separately</p>
<p> The data sets are relatively clean, I removed null values and ignored the police killings for years
  that I did not have education or unemployment data (2020 and 2021). I divided the unemployment numbers by their
  respective county population to get a more accurate representation of unemployment percentages.
  The education data contains the percentage of adults with less than a high school diploma and the percent of adults with a bachelor's
  degree or higher. I did not melt
  the datasets together because the visualizations consist of various layered choropleth maps showing unemployment,
  education, and population per county and then mapping where each police brutality incidence occurred. The dataset
  of police killings includes exact latitude and longitude coordinates of the incidences which I used to map them.</p>

<h2>Purpose of the current work</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study is to find a relationship between social class
  indicators and police brutality. More research needs to be done to demonstrate
  the causes and effects of such violence, which disrupts the relationship between
   a social group and law enforcement. Understanding the causes and effects help
   lead to tangible solutions. </p>

<h2>Findings</h2>

<p> The unemployment map does not show a very clear pattern between the frequency
  of police killings, unemployment, or education rates. Most brutality cases are
  around the East and West coast – meaning areas with denser population rates.
  Although most cases are on or around higher unemployment rates, there does not
  seem to be a high correlation between them. Furthermore, police killings seem to
  be slightly more correlated with higher education levels. This could be because
  these areas tend to be more urban and have higher population numbers. To develop
  this idea further, I also mapped population with a log base 10 and police brutality incidences.
  This map demonstrates that even over time, most brutality cases are in counties with higher population numbers.
  I speculate this could be because there are more police to commit the crime and/or more cases that lead a police
  officer to resort to an unwarranted amount of force against a subject.
  Nevertheless, it is important to note the similarities in brutality “hotspots”
  between years. These show a deeper systemic pattern that has shaped police violence
   in the United States.</p>

<h2>Going Forward</h2>
<p> Understanding the root causes for police violence “hotspots” that the maps
  depict is crucial to reverting systemic trends. The hotspots demonstrate that
  police violence cases are not exceptions, and therefore can be understood with
  further research as to what contributed to these brutality clusters.</p>
<p>Going further in the study of police brutality, it might be insightful
  to focus on metro areas and their surrounding suburbs, where brutality cases
  have been on the rise
  <a href= "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-are-killing-fewer-people-in-big-cities-but-more-in-suburban-and-rural-america/">(Police Are Killing Fewer People In Big Cities, But More In Suburban And Rural America)</a>.
  Furthermore, to address racial discriminatory undertones in systemic police
  violence, it would be useful to visualize the frequency of brutality occurrences
  and the racial composition of areas. </p>
<p>Police violence is not a new problem in the United States.
  It is important to continue research on the roots and effects this has
   not only on specific social and racial groups, but also for society as a whole. </p>
